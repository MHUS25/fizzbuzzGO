# FizzBuzz in GoLang

Writing FizzBuzz in a completely new language!

Why GoLang?
* A powerful language with a relatively small learning curve  
* It does not have many features of modern OOP languages - this new perspective makes it a very interesting language to learn as a beginner!
* Syntax is neat and clean - who doesnâ€™t love readable code?

## Motivations

The focus of this project is to develop a process for picking up and familiarising with the basics of a new programming language in a short space of time. It took ~1 hour to get set up, install relevant tools and learn the basics of GO to write a simple program such as FizzBuzz.
